<P>You'll need this tage at the beginning of every HTMLdoucement you create. It ensures that a <br</P>
<p>browser knows that it's reading HTML, and that is expects HTML5, the lastest version. <br</p>

<p>Even though this isn't actually an HTML tage, it's still good one to know. <br</p> 

<h1> <font> <p> 2. &lt;html&gt;</p></font></h1>
<hr size="4" color="black">
<p>This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML. The &lt;html&gt; tag goes <br</p>
<p>straight after the DOCTYPE tag, and you close it with a &lt;/html> tag right at the end of your <br</p>
<p>file. Everything else in your document goes between these tags</p>

<h1> <font> <p> 3. &lt;head&gt;</p></font></h1>
<hr size="4" color="Black"> 
<p>The &lt;head> tag starts the header section of your file. The stuff that goes in here doesn't <br</p>
<p> on your webpage. Instead, it contains metadata for search engines, and info for <br</p>
<p> browser.</p>
